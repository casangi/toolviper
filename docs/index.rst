Graph Visibility and Image Parallel Execution Reduction
=======================================================

vipercore is a `Dask <https://docs.dask.org/>`_ based MapReduce package. It allows for mapping a dictionary of `xarray.Datasets <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html>`_ to `Dask graph nodes <https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/graphs.html>`_ followed by a reduce step.

**vipercore is in development and breaking API changes will happen.**

The best place to start with vipercore is doing the `graph building tutorial <https://vipercore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/graph_building_tutorial.html>`_ .
